# DataGlide

DataGlide is a streamlined web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to manipulate datasets easily using MitoSheet and visualize them interactively with PyGWalker. Whether you're exploring, cleaning, or visualizing your data, DataGlide provides an intuitive interface for seamless data analysis.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload CSV or Excel files directly into the app.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilize MitoSheet's Excel-like interface to clean, modify, and explore your dataset.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Create dynamic charts and graphs using PyGWalker for better insight and exploration of your data.
- **Real-time Updates**: Any changes made to the data in MitoSheet will reflect instantly in the visualizations.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your Data**: Load your dataset by uploading a CSV or Excel file.
2. **Manipulate Data with MitoSheet**: Once the data is uploaded, use MitoSheet’s interface to filter, sort, and clean the data without writing a single line of code.
3. **Visualize with PyGWalker**: After the data manipulation, seamlessly generate visualizations using PyGWalker, exploring patterns, trends, and insights in your data.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DataGlide.git
   cd DataGlide
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Python installed. Then install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit mitosheet pygwalker pandas
   ```

3. **Run the App:**

   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the app locally or deploy it on a cloud platform.
2. Use the file uploader to select your dataset.
3. Modify the dataset with MitoSheet.
4. Generate visualizations with PyGWalker.
5. Export your modified data and visualizations for further analysis or reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **MitoSheet**: A code-free tool for spreadsheet-like data manipulation.
- **PyGWalker**: For creating interactive, draggable charts and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: Backend data manipulation library.

## Future Improvements
